I need a straightforward bodyweight training program for general physical
condition improvement and maintenance.

As I cannot find or remember something as simple as the
[Primal Blueprint Fitness](https://www.primalblueprint.com/blogs/primal-blueprint/the-primal-blueprint-4-essential-movements)
I'll go for it.

The program starts with the self-assessment to know the progression level I'm
on.

My results are:

- Pushup: 12 reps
- Pullup: 3 reps
- Squat: 65 reps
- Plank: 64 seconds

In terms of progressions, this means my starting point is:

- Pushup: knee pushup
- Pullup: chair-assisted (1 leg)
- Squat: full squat (prisoner)
- Plank: forearm/knee plank + side knee

Let the training begin!
